## Task 1 - Swap list elements

You are given a list and two indizes. Implement a method `swap` that takes the list and the two indizes as arguments, swaps the values at the given indizes and returns the list.

### Input:

```
swap_list = [23, 65, 19, 90]
```

### Output:

```
> swap(swap_list, 1, 3)

[23, 90, 19, 65]
```



## Task 2 - Filter lists

You are given a list of strings. Some of those strings may contain integers, for example `Digital Car33r Institute`. Implement a method `digit_filter` that takes a list of strings as an argument and only returns those strings that don't contain a number.

## Input:

```
l33t = ['Digital Car33r Institute', 'DCI', 'Digital', 'Career', 'Inst1tut3']
```

## Output:

```
> digit_filter(l33t)

['DCI', 'Digital', 'Career']
```
